## Opinions, known bugs & pitfalls

### Opinions

We took some decisions about what is allowed or not in an EBICS parse result. We still don't have found a complete and exhaustive docs about this format. So
everything is based on our guesses. See section "[Whatever](#whatever)".

In transactions items, fields `internal_code` and `operation_code` need at least one of them to be filled.

### Line record code

Most lines start with code `01` (start balance), `07` (end balance), `04` (main transaction line) and `05` (transaction detail line). But we already met lines
with record code `03`. We have guess that it's a very similar usage of record code `04`, so for the moment, when met, transformed in `04`.

### Whatever

- We try to manage when carriage return is not present in the raw text file, we didn't found any bug yet but you probably will. We do the best we can.
- If you find a bug, don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.
- If you have a doc with complete specs, we'll thanks you a lot.
